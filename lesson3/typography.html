       <p>
        I am Victor López, I am a computer programmer. I am from Colombia. 
        In my country, there are so many indigenous and Afro-descendant communities, 
        They work making handicraft objects, but often their work is underestimated 
        or it is not possible to find. Where can you learn about their culture and 
        purchase their products? My website is going to show these communities’ work, 
        and help people buy it easily. My goal is to help these communities to be 
        seen and valued in this world.
